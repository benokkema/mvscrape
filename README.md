# mvscrape
Simple Python script for creating .nfo files for music videos in Kodi

Copyright Ben Okkema 2016

Use it however you like, just buy me a beer if we ever meet

So far all it does is scrape the artist and track title from the filename.
I plan on adding more functionality since none of the built in scrappers worked how I liked.

At the moment filenames MUST be "ARTIST - TITLE.mp4"

Instructions:
Run script in the directory containing all your music videos
